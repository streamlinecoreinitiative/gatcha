## New Features

- **Energy System** introduces separate energy for the campaign and dungeons
  which regenerates over time.

  attempt.

- **Improved Registration** includes email validation and a password reset flow.
- **Security Update** now stores passwords hashed and requires acceptance of a Terms of Service during registration.
- **UI Updates** provide refreshed hero modals and combat log readability.

## PayPal Integration

The store can now process payments via PayPal. Configure your PayPal client ID and secret from the Admin Panel. Once configured, PayPal buttons appear in the store for premium currency purchases.

During checkout the client sends a PayPal `order_id` to `/api/paypal_complete`.
The server verifies the order with PayPal's API and uses `grant_currency()` to credit Platinum to the player.

The old JavaScript prompt for fake receipts has been removed; real purchases are now handled entirely through PayPal Checkout.

### Managing PayPal Credentials
1. Login as an admin user.
2. Open the **Admin** tab.
3. Fill in `PayPal Client ID` and `PayPal Secret` fields.
4. Click **Save PayPal** to apply the settings.

These values are stored in the database and used by the server when rendering PayPal buttons.
