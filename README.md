## PayPal Integration

The store can now process payments via PayPal. Configure your PayPal client ID and secret from the Admin Panel. Once configured, PayPal buttons appear in the store for premium currency purchases. Admins may switch between **Sandbox** and **Live** mode as needed.

During checkout the client sends a PayPal `order_id` to `/api/paypal_complete`.
The server verifies the order with PayPal's API and uses `grant_currency()` to credit Platinum to the player.

The old JavaScript prompt for fake receipts has been removed; real purchases are now handled entirely through PayPal Checkout.

### Managing PayPal Credentials
1. Login as an admin user.
2. Open the **Admin** tab.
3. Fill in `PayPal Client ID` and `PayPal Secret` fields.
4. Choose either **Sandbox** or **Live** mode.
5. Click **Save PayPal** to apply the settings.

These values are stored in the database and used by the server when rendering PayPal buttons.

## Email Configuration

Admins may configure SMTP credentials from the **Admin Panel**. Enter the host, port, username and password under the Email section and click **Save Email**. If no settings are provided, outgoing emails will be written to `sent_emails.log`.
