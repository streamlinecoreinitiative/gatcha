Welcome, Summoner. The world you once knew is gone, shattered into a memory.

In the wake of the Great Shattering, a monument to despair tore through the sky: The Spire of Chaos. It is not a tower of stone and mortar, but a festering wound in reality itself, its floors stretching into a maddening, infinite eternity.

From its endless corridors, the Void-touched pour forth, each floor commanded by a more twisted and powerful guardian than the last. The Spire is the heart of the invasion, the source of the encroaching darkness that consumes our world.

Prophecy speaks of a Rift-Mender—you—who can peer through the chaos. Using Aetherium Crystals, you can summon the only beings capable of withstanding the Spire's corrupting energy: the legendary Star-forged Maidens. These heroines, pulled from across dimensions, are the last hope for Aethelgard.

Your destiny is a vertical one. You must ascend the Spire of Chaos, floor by ever-more-dangerous floor. Your goal is to fight back the tide, to climb higher than any have before, and to perhaps, one day, reach the pinnacle of this impossible tower to seal the rift for good.

The climb is eternal. The enemy is infinite. Your courage must be too.

Gather your heroines. The first floor awaits.
